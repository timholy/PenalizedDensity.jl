    DensityEstimate(x::AbstractVector{T}, κ; support=(-Inf, Inf), rtol=cbrt(eps(T)))

Estimate a continuous one-dimensional probability density from sample points `x`,
using the scalar-field method of Holy, *Phys. Rev. Lett.* **79**, 3545 (1997).

`κ` is either a positive number, giving one scale everywhere, or a callable `κ(x)` returning
the scale local to `x`; larger `κ` gives a rougher estimate. See [`select_kappa_kl`](@ref) for
choosing it automatically (the recommended default; [`select_kappa_cv`](@ref),
[`select_kappa_ms`](@ref), and [`kappa_interval`](@ref) are alternatives).

`support = (a, b)` fits the density on a finite domain instead of all of `ℝ`; either end may be
`-Inf`/`Inf` for a one-sided or fully unbounded fit (the default). The density `Q` is exactly
zero outside `[a, b]`, [`cdf`](@ref) reaches exactly `0` at `a` and `1` at `b`, and every data
point must lie in `[a, b]` (checked at fit time; a violation, or `a ≥ b`, throws a
`DomainError`).

Repeated points, and points closer than `rtol / κ(x)` (i.e. within a fraction `rtol` of
the local smoothing length), are merged into one node carrying the count as its integer
weight, so weighted data is handled naturally. Without merging, the resulting
tridiagonal system can be nearly singular.

The returned object is callable: `d(x)` evaluates the density `Q(x)` at any real
`x`, and it can be broadcast over arrays. Use [`amplitude`](@ref) for `ψ(x)`.

Passing `κ` as a keyword, `DensityEstimate(x; κ)`, is deprecated in favor of the
positional form.

# Examples

julia> d = DensityEstimate([-1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], 1.0);

julia> d(0.0) > d(2.0)   # denser near the data
true

julia> round(chisq(d, d); digits=8)   # a distribution fits itself perfectly
0.0

julia> a = DensityEstimate([-1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], x -> 1 + exp(-x^2));  # sharper near 0

julia> a.κ                                # one rate per inter-node interval
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.778800783071405
 1.778800783071405

julia> u = DensityEstimate(range(0.05, 0.95; length=50), 10.0; support=(0.0, 1.0));

julia> u(-0.1), u(1.1)              # zero outside the support
(0.0, 0.0)

julia> cdf(u, 0.0), cdf(u, 1.0)     # cdf hits 0 and 1 exactly at the walls
(0.0, 1.0)
```

# Extended help

The density is written as `Q(x) = ψ(x)^2`, where the amplitude `ψ` minimizes the action

    S[ψ] = ∫ (λ/κ(x)²) (ψ')² dx - 2 Σᵢ ln ψ(xᵢ)

subject to `∫ ψ² dx = 1`, with `λ` the normalization multiplier. The smoothing scale `κ` sets
the width of each point's contribution, and the penalty weight `1/κ(x)²` on `(ψ')²` is what
keeps the pressure to normalize spatially uniform.

A callable `κ(x)` is evaluated at the midpoint of each inter-node interval, and at the
outermost nodes for the two tails, so the fit resolves a piecewise-constant scale: `d.κ[k]` is
the rate on `(d.x[k], d.x[k+1])`, and `d.κL`, `d.κR` the tail rates. Making `κ` large where the
density is high and small where it is low buys resolution where the data can pay for it.

Between sorted data points `ψ` solves `ψ'' = κ² ψ`, i.e. it is a sum of rising and
falling exponentials, and decays as `e^{-κ|x|}` in the tails. The nodal amplitudes
`ψ(xᵢ)` satisfy a symmetric tridiagonal system whose solution is the minimizer of a
strictly convex potential; normalization is then a rescaling.

At a finite support endpoint the density is left free rather than pinned to zero (a natural, or
Neumann, boundary condition: `ψ'(a) = 0`) — the wall changes only the outermost interval on
that side, replacing its exponential tail with a `cosh` arc pinned flat at the wall, so a
discontinuous or divergent edge (a "jump edge") is representable directly rather than
approximated by a fast-decaying tail.

The goodness-of-fit machinery ([`chisq_reference`](@ref) and everything built on it) supports a
varying `κ` exactly as it does a constant one, and a finite `support` exactly as it does the
unbounded line.

Minimize the strictly convex potential `F(ψ) = ½ ψ'Mψ - Σ wᵢ ln ψᵢ` over `ψ > 0`
by a damped Newton iteration with an SPD tridiagonal Hessian. The minimizer solves
`Mψ = w ./ ψ`, i.e. the field equation at unit multiplier; the caller rescales it
to impose normalization.

Each step factorizes the tridiagonal Hessian in place (`ldlt!`/`ldiv!`) and backtracks
along the Newton direction to keep `ψ > 0` with Armijo decrease. Iteration stops when the
Newton decrement `λ² = ∇FᵀΔ` drops below a relative tolerance, or when the line search can
no longer decrease `F`.

    cdf(d::DensityEstimate, x)

Cumulative distribution function of the fitted density, `F(x) = ∫_a^x Q(t) dt` with `Q = ψ²`
and `a` the fit's left support endpoint (`-Inf` unless [`DensityEstimate`](@ref) was given a
finite `support`), evaluated in closed form (no quadrature). `F` is nondecreasing with
`F(a) == 0` and `F(b) == 1` exactly, and outside a finite `[a, b]` support is exactly `0` at or
below `a` and exactly `1` at or above `b`.

`x` may be a scalar or an array. Each call assembles the per-node cumulative masses at
`O(length(d.x))` cost; the array method assembles them once and shares them across all
evaluations. See [`quantile`](@ref Statistics.quantile) for the inverse.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> d = DensityEstimate([0.0], 0.5);   # a Laplace density centered at 0

julia> cdf(d, 0.0)
0.5

julia> quantile(d, 0.5)

# Extended help

The tails (or, on a finite support, the two boundary segments) are pure exponentials or `cosh`
arcs; on each inter-node interval `ψ'' = κ²ψ` makes `ψ'² - κ²ψ²` constant, which yields the
exact antiderivative of the hyperbolic interpolant. The `F(a) == 0`/`F(b) == 1` endpoints are
exact because the few ulps of normalization roundoff in the fitted amplitudes are absorbed by a
global rescaling.

are derived for the unbounded line and do not generalize to a finite domain, so it always
fits (and returns a scale for) the unbounded problem.

search, bracketed by the grid `κs`. This is a principled convention rather than a unique
optimum: `S` has no exact stationary point in `κ`, so the flattest point depends on measuring
sensitivity in `ln κ`.

    kappa_interval(x; level=0.2, rtol=1e-6) -> (; κ, lo, hi)

Principled smoothing-scale selection returning a point value and an interval of plausible
scales. `κ` is the half-entropy scale — the `h = 1/2` point of the entropy fraction `h(κ)`
defined below — and `lo`, `hi` bracket `h ∈ [(1-level)/2, (1+level)/2]`, so the default
`level=0.2` spans `h ∈ [0.4, 0.6]`. Requires at least two distinct points.

This entropy criterion is distinct from the minimum-sensitivity scale of
[`select_kappa_ms`](@ref); one advantage of this function is that it doesn't require computing
a noisy numerical derivative.

This selector takes no `support` keyword: the exact `κ → 0`/`κ → ∞` entropy limits it relies
on are derived for the unbounded line, so it always fits (and returns a scale for) the
unbounded problem.

# Extended help

As `κ` sweeps from `0` to `∞` the classical action's reduced form `g(κ) = S(κ) + W ln κ`
(with `W = Σ wᵢ` the total count) rises monotonically between two exact limits:
`g → W/2` as `κ → 0` (all points merge into one lump) and `g → W/2 + W H` as `κ → ∞`
(the `N` points become isolated), where `H = -Σᵢ (wᵢ/W) ln(wᵢ/W)` is the Shannon entropy
of the multiplicities (`ln N` for distinct points). The normalized quantity

    h(κ) = (g(κ) - W/2) / (W H) ∈ [0, 1]

is therefore the fraction of the data's entropy that scale `κ` resolves, and its half-point
`h = 1/2` is returned as `κ`.

`∫(Q̂_κ - Q)²`, where `Q̂_{κ,-i}` is the density fitted with the `i`-th point left out. Its
minimizer therefore targets minimum mean integrated squared error (MISE). This generally
selects a finer scale than [`select_kappa_ms`](@ref) (minimum sensitivity) and
[`kappa_interval`](@ref) (half-entropy), which resolve information rather than squared error
and tend to over-resolve smooth densities.

`support = (a, b)` (default `(-Inf, Inf)`) fits and cross-validates on a finite domain, as
[`DensityEstimate`](@ref)'s `support` does; it is a fixed hyperparameter of the search, not
itself selected, and is held fixed across every candidate `κ`. Data outside `[a, b]`, or
`a ≥ b`, throws a `DomainError`. `κs` must be sorted and positive, with at least three values
to bracket the minimum, and defaults to a geometric range scaled to the data's extent.

Cross-validation assumes the data are draws from a continuous density. Heavily tied or coarsely
rounded data instead resemble a discrete distribution, for which `LSCV` decreases without bound
as `κ → ∞` (finer scales keep resolving the atoms); `select_kappa_cv` then returns a large `κ`.
Prefer [`select_kappa_ms`](@ref) or [`kappa_interval`](@ref), which stay bounded, in that regime.

Choose a *spatially varying* smoothing scale by Kullback–Leibler cross-validation, and
return it ready to pass to [`DensityEstimate`](@ref).

Returns an [`AdaptiveScale`](@ref) when some `α` in `alphas` beats the constant scale, and
the constant scale itself (a number, so the fit takes the constant-`κ` path and its
goodness-of-fit machinery stays available) otherwise. The constant scale always competes, on
the same score, so the returned scale is adaptive only if adaptivity wins. Selection costs a
small multiple of one [`select_kappa_kl`](@ref) call; shorten `alphas` to trade capture for
speed.

The `alphas` must be positive: `α = 0` is the constant scale, which is always in the
comparison. They are searched in increasing order, whatever order they are given in.
`pilot_selector` sets the constant scale of the pilot density the family is built from, and
may be any callable returning a positive scale from the sample. `rtol` is the node-merging
tolerance, as a fraction of the local smoothing length, matching [`DensityEstimate`](@ref)'s.

`support = (a, b)` (default `(-Inf, Inf)`) fits the pilot density and cross-validates every
candidate scale on a finite domain, as [`DensityEstimate`](@ref)'s `support` does; it is a
fixed hyperparameter of the search, not itself selected, and is held fixed across every
candidate `α`/`c`. Data outside `[a, b]`, or `a ≥ b`, throws a `DomainError`. Composing this
selector with [`select_support`](@ref) — which chooses `support` (and a constant `κ`) by the
same cross-validation score — is two documented steps, not one entry point: call
`select_support` first, then pass its `support` here, then fit `DensityEstimate(x, κ;
support)` with the scale this returns.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> x = -log.(1 .- (0.5:999.5) ./ 1000);   # exponential: a jump at the left edge

julia> κ = select_kappa_adaptive(x);          # adaptivity wins here

julia> κ.α                                    # the selected exponent
0.5

julia> d = DensityEstimate(x, κ);

julia> extrema(d.κ)[2] / extrema(d.κ)[1] > 100   # far finer at the edge than in the tail
true

julia> select_kappa_adaptive(range(0, 1; length=1000)) isa Real   # uniform: nothing to buy
true
```

# Extended help

A single scale must trade resolution in the bulk against noise in the tails. Letting `κ`
follow the density lifts that trade-off, and buys the most where a constant scale is limited
not by noise but by the density's own irregularity: a divergent or discontinuous edge, a
kink, or heavy tails. On smooth densities there is nothing to buy, and this selector says so
— it returns a plain number, the constant scale, whenever adaptivity does not earn its
keep by the same cross-validation score that chose it.

The rule is a plug-in: fit a pilot density `p̂` at the constant scale `pilot_selector(x)` (by
default [`select_kappa_kl`](@ref)), then consider the family

    κ(x; c, α) = c · (p̂(x) / ḡ)^α,     ḡ = geometric mean of p̂ over the sample

(an [`AdaptiveScale`](@ref)). For each exponent `α` in `alphas`, `c` is chosen by
golden-section search on the leave-one-out score `KLCV(κ) = -(1/N) Σᵢ wᵢ ln Q̂₋ᵢ(xᵢ)`
generalized to a varying scale — the same criterion [`select_kappa_kl`](@ref) minimizes,
and, like it, evaluated in closed form and `O(N)`, with no refitting. The constant scale
competes as the `α = 0` member of the same family and on the same score.

`pilot_selector` is a scale-selection method, and is called on the sample alone with no notion
of `support`; the pilot density it scales is what is fitted on `support`. So a selector with no
notion of a boundary, like [`select_kappa_ms`](@ref), remains usable as `pilot_selector` on a
bounded domain. Because `support` is fixed throughout the `α` search, composing with
[`select_support`](@ref) re-runs that search on each boundary arm's own domain, so `α` gets to
respond to whatever regularity a boundary already bought, rather than being reused from an
unbounded selection that saw a different edge.

Choose a domain `support = (a, b)` — either side possibly infinite — together with the
smoothing scale `κ`, jointly, by the same Kullback–Leibler cross-validation score
[`select_kappa_kl`](@ref) minimizes. Pass the result straight to [`DensityEstimate`](@ref):

    r = select_support(x)
    d = DensityEstimate(x, r.κ; support = r.support)

A boundary is imposed on a side only when it wins that cross-validation, never assumed from
the fact that one side of the data has an edge; a side that does not win stays `±Inf`. A
finite boundary is always placed outward of the extreme data point on its side, and never
closer to it than five times the mean spacing of the data near that edge. When neither side
wins, the support is `(-Inf, Inf)` and the returned `κ` equals `kappa(x; κs, rtol)` exactly —
a family with nothing to gain from a boundary gets the standalone selection itself, not
merely something close to it.

`kappa` (default [`select_kappa_kl`](@ref)) must share [`select_kappa_kl`](@ref)'s
`(x; κs, rtol, support)` interface, as [`select_kappa_cv`](@ref) does. `κs` and `rtol` are
passed through to it, and set the golden-section bracket and the node-merging tolerance (a
fraction of the local smoothing length) throughout the search.

# Examples

# Extended help

Each side is searched independently and sequentially — the left boundary first (with the
right side unbounded), then the right boundary against the left side's winner — and on each
side the unbounded (`±Inf`) candidate always competes: that side gets a finite boundary only
if the best finite candidate's KLCV beats the score of leaving it unbounded by more than a
small margin (screening out golden-section/floating-point noise, not a real effect size). A
wall is not always safe to add: placed too far past the data it can raise the KLCV score
rather than lower it (a flat field props mass into an empty margin where a decaying tail would
not).

A finite candidate on one side is a gap `Δ > 0`, the distance *outward* from the extreme data
point on that side (`a = x₁ - Δ` on the left, `b = x_N + Δ` on the right), searched by
golden-section on `ln Δ` over a bracket of `[5, 100]` times the mean spacing of the ten data
points nearest that edge (extensible further outward, never inward). The lower end is a hard
floor, not merely a starting guess: closer than a few edge spacings, a natural boundary
reflects the nearest interior points back onto the extreme point and inflates its leave-one-out
likelihood on *any* sample, edge or not, so gaps tighter than the floor are excluded rather
than searched (this is a property of the reflecting boundary condition itself — confirmed
against a brute-force leave-one-out refit — not a search artifact). `κ` is re-selected at every
gap candidate rather than held fixed, because the two are coupled at a hard edge (the optimal
`κ` can move to a fraction of its unbounded value once a wall is added); candidates are
searched from the widest gap to the narrowest, and each candidate's `κ` search is warm-started
in a narrow window about the *previous* candidate's optimum rather than repeating a full search
from scratch, since `κ*` moves continuously with the gap.

`kappa` is consulted at two points only: once at the start, to seed the unbounded arm's
competing score and the first (and widest) gap candidate's `κ` warm start; and once at the
end, to refine `κ` at the winning support over the full `κs` bracket a standalone call would
use (the chained inner searches above use a narrower window, for speed). When neither side
wins, no refinement call is made and the returned `κ` *is* that first call. The gap-path
searches themselves score every candidate directly by the KLCV score `select_kappa_kl` uses,
not by calling `kappa` per candidate.
